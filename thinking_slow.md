#The Journey Ahead
##Welcome to Programming

Coming into programming I was under the impression that solutions to problems would
be neat and tightly packaged. There would be one optimal programmatic truth that
each issue would bow to. A short while later I have realized that problems can be
solved a number of ways and, while there are certainly better approaches, the solutions
are many and code is never done.

As a new programmer, it is incredibly easy to become overwhelmed. Thoughts of impostor
syndrome start to creep in as mentors refactor with blazing speed and talking heads
discuss programming in tongues that seem alien. This is when it becomes important to
slow down and take an objective look at the road ahead. Focus on absorbing what you can
from the journey rather than being worried about an ideal destination. No matter where
you are headed be confident that your future self will have a better grasp on
whatever it is that intimidates you currently.

To help you along on your journey it is important to find ideas and individuals that
inspire you. I personally recommend exploring a wide range of teachers from books and
blogs to user groups and mentors so you can find what best works for you. One figure
I suggest you look into is Sandi Metz.

Author of *Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby*, Sandi is a programmer of more
than 30 years with a background in Ruby and Smalltalk. Sandi has the uncanny ability to
break down complex problems into the simplest of terms. Even if a concept may escape a
novice programmer, her language demystifies software design in a way that makes
growing to a higher level of understanding feel very attainable.

In this [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE) from RailsConf 2014,
Sandi discusses her approach to The Gilded Rose Kata. In case you were wondering:

> A kata is a choreograped sequence of movements provided by a master to help his students
> internalize the fundamentals of the art.

In programming, code katas are used for a similar goal of internalizing fundamentals.
Through her speech about solving this particular kata, Sandi shares some gems of
information that I feel are very useful for a budding programmer.

Sandi discusses the benefit of thinking smaller and writing simpler methods. As a
junior programmer it is easy to fall into the trap of trying to plan an entire working
solution with no working parts. As my instructor Russell has taught me, it is important
to be able to break things down into smaller problems. Once you have one bit of code
running you can move onto the piece in the puzzle.

The presentation continues through a very elegant solving of the Gilded Rose Kata that
offers a number of additional suggestions. Sandi suggests that being patient and making the
right choices when refactoring can save you a lot of complexity in the longterm. With
the right amount of practice and exposure there is no reason that you can't be solving
the same code katas before you know it.
